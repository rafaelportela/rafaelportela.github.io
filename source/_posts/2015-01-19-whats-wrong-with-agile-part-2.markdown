Erik Meijer did an - at least - [interesting talk](http://vimeo.com/110554082) about the Hacker Way, saying Agile is a cancer, developers should think about code all the time and have millionaire salaries, followed by complaints directed to managers.
Althought most of his specific arguments are wisely beated [here](http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/), I could not entirelly disagree with Erik.
There's something subtle in those words that makes us, developers, bring up a small smile when watching this kind of speach. Unfortunately, I think this reflects our inability to deal with the business layer in our own projects and companies. And it's our fault.

First of all, I understand the snake oil, the certification market, and the pool of people talking about how Agile is cool without showing results. Having a (good or not) story to tell would be more interesting.
Also, the Agile thing - or whatever you call Agile - might not be a [hot product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle) anymore to some people after one decade and a half being redirected to that [geocities-like] (http://www.wonder-tonic.com/geocitiesizer/) manifesto page. I'm just missing the marquee title.
It should be more contextualized, it was a result of what was working on the early internet companies, and helped the whole industry to understand that software projects should not be seen as others engineering projects.
The point here is that Erik is blaming something else and calling it agile.

Erik says managers should only set the context and keep developers happy. I totally agree the later task should be a super-mega-ultra-power priority ;) I don't think setting the context is that simple, though.
In a more traditional management style, there is the boss which has all the brilliant business strategy in his head.
He can smoke his cigar on his room at the highest level of the building, admiring the city, while his soldiers execute his perfect plans.
You know him. You work for him. He has lots of people under him to assist him on his plans. You also know them, they are you managers.
